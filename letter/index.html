        to our Third Maria.
      </p>
      <p>
        it’s been more than 2 years since I’ve been committed to making our dreams
        possible every step of the way. and all the while, we made lasting memories
        that will etch in our hearts forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        the first time I met you on socials, I was just about to start my career as a
        vtuber after learning about what had happened to MIKENEKO (formerly Uruha
        Rushia) last Feb. from the first time that you streamed, it was an
        exhilarating experience at hand. every stream was memorable, and all the
        while, we have created a community unlike any other.
      </p>
      <p>
        through your three debuts, I’ve learned about what makes you great, and what
        more possibilities could we possibly create for the future of vtubing. and
        despite all the circumstances, we braced through these with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        23 Jun 2022 saw an opportunity for us to foster our relationships with the
        community through meaningful experiences. I can still remember the day when I
        decided to take part that you said, “you being an overarching mod would be my
        dream”; and I devoted my life to it after the deliberations, making sure that
        the community is safe against all odds.
      </p>
      <p>
        through all that experience, we gained so much momentum, and we passed along
        our legacies and memories to the community as we went along. that alone made
        me convinced the future is bright for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        we braced through all the hurdles, faced the consequences; all while holding
        each other tight. and through many of these, we met new people that we can
        count on. communities that we can look forward to.
      </p>
      <p>
        it has been these wonderful years that I realized that every moment that we
        had together was fun. and I still carry on those memories whenever I do
        creative works or moderate other vtubers. it pursued me to do something I’ve
        not completely done, and what I was supposed to do from the start since
        meeting you.
      </p>
      <p>
        27 Dec 2022, and it has arrived. with a bit of dedication on my side, I
        decided to make a handwritten illust that will uphold our hearts into one
        Collective that strives to recognize the importance of universality at its
        core. who would’ve thought that a simple artwork could create such new
        memories together, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
        but life isn’t that sweet at the end of the day, however. I’ve seen you
        struggle to find your common ground, but all the while, I continue to support
        you with everything that I can. sending you comforting messages, publishing
        wips, it has been an experience unlike any other.
      </p>
      <p>
        but now, we’re here. after many trials and tribulations, it’s time to put
        everything to rest for good. I know it has been a painful experience, even for
        me; but I know that deep inside, there’s still a part of us that is willing to
        do whatever it takes to make everyone proud in our own ways. living a new life
        out of the previous will be hard, but I know that we can do it as long as our
        hearts are bound together -- set in stone for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        there will be some trouble ahead of you, but just know that with every
        struggle comes relief. with every step of the way, we found our common ground.
        and when one story ends, another one begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that you’ve found peace in your heart and mind as you continue your
        recovery further. things will be hard, but I’m sure that your efforts will be
        rewarded. it may take a while to get used to the new life, but I’m in the mood
        to say that it’s all gonna be worth it in the end. I’m sure of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        but for now, I would like to thank you -- personally -- for all the memories
        that we made and cherished. we may leave most of it behind, our most precious
        ones will be in our hearts beyond time. we know that we will meet each other
        again when the time comes, after every single thing has all settled down. who
        knows when that will happen, maybe years or decades? but hey, it’s a
        possibility!!
      </p>
      <p>
        but I would like to sincerely thank you for what you’ve done to the community.
        your dedication to do something great is something that I’ve been catered to
        since meeting you and becoming a vtuber. it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
        that I won’t let pass, let alone miss out on it. it’s the legacy that we made
        together, and I’m now glad to hold it dearly in my heart for future
        generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        to this, I formally close this letter with the following: I’m glad that I
        finally found my resolve and my desire to keep going with my life thanks to
        you. I’m sincerely thankful to be sharing these memories with you. and lastly,
        I’m truly honored to become the 💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸 that I am right now thanks to
        your care.
      </p>
      <p><b>
        I am truly grateful to have always regarded you as the Third Maria. you will
        always be in our hearts forever.💗🌸
