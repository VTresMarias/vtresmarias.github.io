                to our Third Maria.
              </p>
              <p>
                it’s been more than 2 years since I’ve been committed to making our dreams
                possible every step of the way. and all the while, we made lasting memories
                that will etch in our hearts forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                the first time I met you on socials, I was just about to start my career as a
                vtuber after learning about what had happened to MIKENEKO (formerly Uruha
                Rushia) last Feb. from the first time that you streamed, it was an
                exhilarating experience at hand. every stream was memorable, and all the
                while, we have created a community unlike any other.
              </p>
              <p>
                through your three debuts, I’ve learned about what makes you great, and what
                more possibilities could we possibly create for the future of vtubing. and
                despite all the circumstances, we braced through these with ease.
              </p>
              <p>
                23 Jun 2022 saw an opportunity for us to foster our relationships with the
                community through meaningful experiences. I can still remember the day when I
                decided to take part that you said, “you being an overarching mod would be my
                dream”; and I devoted my life to it after the deliberations, making sure that
                the community is safe against all odds.
              </p>
              <p>
                through all that experience, we gained so much momentum, and we passed along
                our legacies and memories to the community as we went along. that alone made
                me convinced the future is bright for us.
              </p>
              <p>
                we braced through all the hurdles, faced the consequences; all while holding
                each other tight. and through many of these, we met new people that we can
                count on. communities that we can look forward to.
              </p>
              <p>
                it has been these wonderful years that I realized that every moment that we
                had together was fun. and I still carry on those memories whenever I do
                creative works or moderate other vtubers. it pursued me to do something I’ve
                not completely done, and what I was supposed to do from the start since
                meeting you.
              </p>
              <p>
                27 Dec 2022, and it has arrived. with a bit of dedication on my side, I
                decided to make a handwritten illust that will uphold our hearts into one
                Collective that strives to recognize the importance of universality at its
                core. who would’ve thought that a simple artwork could create such new
                memories together, eh?
              </p>
              <p>
                but life isn’t that sweet at the end of the day, however. I’ve seen you
                struggle to find your common ground, but all the while, I continue to support
                you with everything that I can. sending you comforting messages, publishing
                wips, it has been an experience unlike any other.
              </p>
              <p>
                but now, we’re here. after many trials and tribulations, it’s time to put
                everything to rest for good. I know it has been a painful experience, even for
                me; but I know that deep inside, there’s still a part of us that is willing to
                do whatever it takes to make everyone proud in our own ways. living a new life
                out of the previous will be hard, but I know that we can do it as long as our
                hearts are bound together -- set in stone for generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                there will be some trouble ahead of you, but just know that with every
                struggle comes relief. with every step of the way, we found our common ground.
                and when one story ends, another one begins.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope that you’ve found peace in your heart and mind as you continue your
                recovery further. things will be hard, but I’m sure that your efforts will be
                rewarded. it may take a while to get used to the new life, but I’m in the mood
                to say that it’s all gonna be worth it in the end. I’m sure of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                but for now, I would like to thank you -- personally -- for all the memories
                that we made and cherished. we may leave most of it behind, our most precious
                ones will be in our hearts beyond time. we know that we will meet each other
                again when the time comes, after every single thing has all settled down. who
                knows when that will happen, maybe years or decades? but hey, it’s a
                possibility!!
              </p>
              <p>
                but I would like to sincerely thank you for what you’ve done to the community.
                your dedication to do something great is something that I’ve been catered to
                since meeting you and becoming a vtuber. it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
                that I won’t let pass, let alone miss out on it. it’s the legacy that we made
                together, and I’m now glad to hold it dearly in my heart for future
                generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                to this, I formally close this letter with the following: I’m glad that I
                finally found my resolve and my desire to keep going with my life thanks to
                you. I’m sincerely thankful to be sharing these memories with you. and lastly,
                I’m truly honored to become the 💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸 that I am right now thanks to
                your care.
              </p>
              <p><b>
                I am truly grateful to have always regarded you as the Third Maria. you will
                always be in our hearts forever.💗🌸
